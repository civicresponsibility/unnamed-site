{% if not pledge.is_from_long_ago %}We are about to make your campaign contributions to {{pledge.targets_summary}}.{% else %}On {{pledge.created|date}} you asked us to schedule campaign contributions depending on the outcome of a {{pledge.trigger.trigger_type.strings.action_noun}}. That {{pledge.trigger.trigger_type.strings.action_noun}} has now occurred. Here is what happens next:

We will be charging your credit card and distributing your contributions shortly. Your contributions will go to {{pledge.targets_summary}}.{% endif %}

Your credit card will be charged ${{total_charge|floatformat:2}}.{% if total_charge < pledge.amount %} This is less than the ${{pledge.amount|floatformat:2}} you scheduled. We can only make whole-penny contributions to the recipients of your contribution, so we had to round down.{% endif %}

{% if pledge.tip_to_campaign_owner > 0 %}You also asked us to add a ${{pledge.tip_to_campaign_owner|floatformat:2}} contribution to {{pledge.via_campaign.owner.name}}. Your credit card will be charged for that as well.

{% endif %}If you no longer wish to make these contributions, please head over to the following address and cancel them. You can cancel your contributions any time before {{until}}.

{{pledge.via_campaign.get_short_url}}

Thanks!
